## :scroll: Description
<!--- Describe your app in one or two sentences -->

The app shows a list of dog breeds fetched from an API (thedogapi.com). It features a main list,
detail screen, about page and a search feature.

## :bulb: Motivation and Context
<!--- Optionally point readers to interesting parts of your submission. -->
<!--- What are you especially proud of? -->

I wanted to get familiar with Jetpack Compose; this is my first project built with it. I took the
opportunity to try out `kotlinx.serialization`, Ktor, Navigation Component, and Coil to see how they
fit within a Compose app. Turns out: pretty nicely!
